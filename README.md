# TinyNets
NeuralNetwork musings powered by tinygrad

This is a _personal project_ to figure out how to use Tinygrad to make Neural nets and learn the stuff. The roadmap is to get TinyDense as a basic Dense NN to do MNIST, then
perhaps try CIFAR, and after that implementing papers, focusing on the code and not in coding yer own framework.
